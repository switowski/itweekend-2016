What to extend:

* Add examples of numpy for some mathematical computations - the use of array data structure is way faster
* Show screenshots of different profiling tools
* Mention that there are different kind of profilers (memory profiler vs standard cProfile)
* Maybe show a quick example of PyPy for some standard code and explanation when PyPy can be faster (for example, it can see that you have a list of integers and optimizes it) ? PyPy won't be faster for like 1-time data moving from one place to another.
